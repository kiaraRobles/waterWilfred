# WaterWilfredApp


Introduction:

WaterWilfred is an iOS App, which generates and tracks required water intake specific to each user.
You may have heard different recommendations for daily water intake. Most people have been told they should drink 6 to 8 glasses of water each day, which is a reasonable goal. However, different people need different amount of water to stay hydrated. Therefore, we have created this app to help everyone stay hydrated. 

WaterWilfred App Details:

a)- After the user installs the app, the user will be asked to grant WaterWilfred to push notification.
b)- Then the user will be asked to enter his/her current weight, which will determine the amount of water intake per day and notification frequency. An Example: if the water intake is equal to 4 glasses of water per day the user will be notified 4 times, with reasonable delay between notifications.

Third Party Code:

WaterWilfred is using the following CocoaPods:
1- We are using ACPReminder 1.0.2 to push notification to users- remind users to hydrate.
